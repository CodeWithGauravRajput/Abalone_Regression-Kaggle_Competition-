## About the Competition:

Welcome to the **Abalone Regression** Kaggle competition! In this challenge, participants are tasked with building regression models to predict the age of abalone, a type of marine mollusk, based on various physical measurements. Abalone age prediction is crucial for sustainable management of abalone fisheries, making this competition both scientifically relevant and impactful.

### Dataset:

The dataset provided for this competition contains observations of various physical attributes of abalones, such as length, diameter, height, and weight. The target variable in this dataset is the number of rings, which can be used to estimate the age of the abalone. With over [number] samples, this dataset offers ample opportunities for participants to develop accurate regression models.

### Objective:

The primary objective of this competition is to develop regression models that can accurately predict the age (number of rings) of abalones based on their physical characteristics. Participants are encouraged to explore various regression techniques, feature engineering strategies, and model evaluation methods to achieve the highest predictive performance.
### Evaluation:

Submissions will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The model with the lowest RMSLE on a separate validation set will be ranked highest on the leaderboard.
